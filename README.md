## Introducing... TOURIST TYCOON ðŸ§³ðŸ’¼ðŸ›« (Elevator Pitch)
How would you like to go to Hong Kong? Or Australia? Or Ecuador? Or Europe? Everyone loves the rush of dopamine at the idea of getting away and vacationing ðŸ˜Ž. I mean, come on, wouldn't you rather go skydiving or embark on a cruise or sample fine dining as opposed to taking 18 credits and stressing over your chess project? There's only one thing cooler than that and that is money ðŸ¤‘. Tourist Tycoon is an online game that gets you _both_! You get to start your own travel agency and work your way up to colonize the world... at least in terms of travel. Invite your friends to play and see who can become the biggest Tourist Tycoon!
