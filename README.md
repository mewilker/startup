## Introducing... TOURIST TYCOON ðŸ§³ðŸ’¼ðŸ›« (Elevator Pitch)
How would you like to go to Hong Kong? Or Australia? Or Ecuador? Or Europe? Everyone loves the rush of dopamine at the idea of getting away and vacationing ðŸ˜Ž. I mean, come on, wouldn't you rather go skydiving or embark on a cruise or sample fine dining as opposed to taking 18 credits and stressing over your chess project? There's only one thing cooler than that and that is money ðŸ¤‘. Tourist Tycoon is an online game that gets you _both_! You get to start your own travel agency and work your way up to colonize the world... at least in terms of travel. Invite your friends to play and see who can become the biggest Tourist Tycoon!

### HTML Additions:

**index.html** - has news and information about the game
**register.html** - has a form including username, password and email. There is also a disclaimer saying I store the data and put the username out there.
**login.html** - similar to register, but doesn't include the disclaimer or ask for the email
**leaderboard** - shows ranking, score (which will be in net worth) and username. Available to public as well as players.
**agency.html** - the main part of where the magic happens. there is a button for each upgrade, an image that will call an external service and get a picture based on the players locations. There is also the stub for websocket notifications that will alert other players when someone has expanded to another location. Also includes the players current bank account
**locations.html** - the next part of where the magic happens. A canvas element is here that has been stubbed to show a world map. Later, it will be interactable and allow players to click and see where they can expand to.
