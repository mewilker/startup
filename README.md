## Introducing... TOURIST TYCOON ðŸ§³ðŸ’¼ðŸ›« (Elevator Pitch)
How would you like to go to Hong Kong? Or Australia? Or Ecuador? Or Europe? Let's face it, the rush of dopamine at the idea of getting away and vacationing is great ðŸ˜Ž. I mean, come on, wouldn't you rather go skydiving or on a cruise or fine dining as opposed to taking 18 credits and stressing over your chess project? There's only one thing cooler than that and that is money ðŸ¤‘. Tourist Tycoon is an online game that gets you _both_! You get to start your own travel agency and work your way open to colonize the world... at least in terms of travel. Invite your friends to play too and see who can get the biggest Tourist Tycoon!
